# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## LLM Documentation Resources

For AI coding assistants working with this SDK, the following resources are available:

- **`llms.txt`** - Indexed quick reference with code examples
- **`llms-full.txt`** - Comprehensive documentation (~25KB) with complete API reference
- **`dist/index.d.ts`** - TypeScript type definitions (after build)
- **API Docs**: https://sdk-docs.sogni.ai

When helping users with Sogni SDK tasks, consult `llms-full.txt` for complete parameter references, especially for video generation where WAN 2.2 and LTX-2.3 models have different behaviors.

These are public agent-facing docs shipped with the npm package. They are kept aligned with:

- `package.json` for package version, runtime engines, npm scripts, exports, and published files.
- `src/index.ts` for public SDK namespaces and root exports.
- `src/Projects/types/index.ts`, `src/Projects/utils/index.ts`, and `src/Projects/createJobRequestMessage.ts` for media-generation parameters and video frame behavior.
- `src/Chat/types.ts`, `src/Chat/index.ts`, `src/Chat/tools.ts`, and `src/Chat/hostedToolValidation.generated.ts` for chat, hosted tools, structured outputs, and durable runs.
- `src/CreativeWorkflows/` and `src/Replay/` for durable workflow and RunRecord APIs.

Current public API anchors:

- The SDK runtime requirement is **Node.js >=22** (`package.json#engines`).
- Socket-native LLM chat uses `sogni.chat.completions.create()`.
- Durable creative workflows use `sogni.workflows`.
- Project cost helpers are `sogni.projects.estimateCost()`, `estimateVideoCost()`, and `estimateAudioCost()`.
- `checkAuth()` is only for cookie-auth browser flows. API-key auth auto-authenticates during `createInstance()`, and token auth uses `login()` or `setTokens()`.
- `ChatCompletionResult` is SDK-shaped (`content`, `role`, `finishReason`, `tool_calls`, `usage`, `cost`). Streaming chunks expose `chunk.content` and optional `chunk.tool_calls`.

## Public Release Security

This repository, its history, npm tarballs, generated declarations, documentation,
examples, tests, and release notes are public and may be inspected by adversarial
automation. Treat every committed or published byte as externally visible.

- Publish only the minimum client contract needed for interoperability. Do not
  expose private enforcement logic, diagnostic classifications, thresholds,
  control state, administrative behavior, or instructions for evading controls.
- Keep authorization, billing, eligibility, abuse prevention, and content-policy
  enforcement server-authoritative. Client-provided values are untrusted and may
  be omitted, forged, replayed, or varied deliberately.
- Public responses and types should use coarse, stable, user-actionable results.
  Detailed diagnostics belong in private service logs and authenticated internal
  administration surfaces.
- Before changing a sensitive public surface, inspect all consumers and generated
  artifacts, preserve required wire compatibility, and review the packed release
  for accidental disclosure.
- If implementation details have already been published, assume they are known.
  Fix or rotate the server-side control instead of relying on deletion or renaming.

## Sogni Intelligence APIs

The SDK wraps the public Sogni Intelligence endpoints used for text chat, hosted creative tools, durable chat turns, and deterministic multi-step workflows.

- `sogni.chat.completions.create()` maps to socket-native chat completions and supports text, streaming, vision input, custom function tools, Sogni tool injection, structured outputs, and `think` / `taskProfile` controls.
- `sogni.chat.hosted.create()` maps to `POST /v1/chat/completions`, the OpenAI-compatible REST chat endpoint. It can execute Sogni media-generation and composition tools server-side.
- `sogni.chat.hosted.executeTool()` maps to `POST /v1/creative-agent/tools/execute` for direct execution of known synchronous composition/planning tools (`enhance_prompt`, `compose_script`, `compose_lyrics`, `compose_instrumental`, `compose_workflow`, `compose_workflow_template`) without an LLM dispatcher round.
- `sogni.chat.runs` maps to `/v1/chat/runs`, a durable hosted-chat turn with persisted state, event replay, cancellation, and recovery across client disconnects.
- `sogni.workflows` maps to `/v1/creative-agent/workflows`, where callers submit exact multi-step creative plans and observe durable execution through snapshots, event logs, or SSE.
- `sogni.workflows.templates` maps to `/v1/creative-agent/workflows/templates`, the CRUD and fork API for saved, parameterized workflow recipes.
- `sogni.replay` maps to `/v1/replay/records`, the RunRecord write/list/get surface for replay viewers and audit tooling.

Public chat and workflow media rules:

- Vision chat accepts inline PNG or JPEG `data:` URIs through OpenAI-style `image_url` content parts.
- Durable chat runs and creative workflows use retrievable HTTP(S) media references, often produced by Sogni upload/download URL helpers.
- Request media references are addressable by media index in hosted tool and workflow calls, so later steps can reuse uploaded or generated images, videos, and audio without copying URLs into prompts.

## Overview

This is the **Sogni SDK for JavaScript/Node.js** - a TypeScript client library for the Sogni Supernet, a DePIN protocol for creative AI inference. The SDK supports image generation (Stable Diffusion, Flux, Z-Image / Z-Image Turbo, Krea 2 Turbo, Krea 2 Identity Edit, Chroma v.46 Flash / v.48 Detail / Chroma1-HD, Qwen image-edit models, GPT Image 2, plus community fine-tunes such as Dark Beast Z-Image Turbo v9, Dark Beast KREA 2, Dark Beast Krea 2 Identity Edit, and One Obsession v22), video generation (WAN 2.2, Wan 3, LTX-2.3, Seedance 2.0, HappyHorse 1.1, MiniMax H3, and MiniMax H3 Turbo), audio generation (ACE-Step 1.5), LLM chat with tool calling, hosted creative tools, durable creative workflows, replay records, and multimodal vision chat (Qwen3.6 35B VLM, default `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-gguf-iq4xs`). The model catalog is discovered dynamically at runtime (`sogni.projects.getAvailableModels()`); model ids listed here are illustrative.

Choosing an image-edit model: pick by what the edit has to preserve, not by step count or quality tier. When a person or character must stay recognisable through the edit — style transfer, makeover, clothing or person swap, face swap, new pose or expression, character sheet — use Krea 2 Identity Edit (`krea2_identity_edit_v1_2`, or `dark_beast_krea2_identity_edit_v1_2` uncensored) with 1-2 context images. For general-purpose editing — photo transforms, in-image text, multi-person changes, combining up to 3 references — use a Qwen image-edit model. A higher-step general-purpose editor does not beat the identity model at a likeness task; it reinterprets the subject instead of preserving it. See `llms.txt` for parameters.

Runtime and packaging:

- Node.js `>=22` is required by `package.json`.
- CommonJS build: `dist/index.js`; ESM build: `dist-esm/index.js`; type declarations: `dist/index.d.ts`.
- Published package files include `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `dist/`, `dist-esm/`, and `src/`.

## Architecture

### Entry Point & Main Classes

**SogniClient** (`src/index.ts`) - Main entry point, created via `SogniClient.createInstance()`:
- `account: AccountApi` - Authentication, balance, rewards
- `projects: ProjectsApi` - Create/track AI generation jobs
- `stats: StatsApi` - Leaderboard data
- `chat: ChatApi` - Unified chat namespace:
  - `chat.completions.create` - Socket-native synchronous chat
  - `chat.hosted.create` - Hosted synchronous chat via `/v1/chat/completions`
  - `chat.runs.{create, get, cancel, streamEvents}` - Durable hosted chat runs via `/v1/chat/runs` with SSE replay
  - `chat.tools` - Tool helpers (build, parse, validate)
- `workflows: CreativeWorkflowsApi` - Durable explicit creative workflows via `/v1/creative-agent/workflows`
  - `workflows.{start, list, get, events, streamEvents, resume, reseed, cancel}`
  - `workflows.templates.{list, get, create, update, delete, fork}`
- `replay: ReplayApi` - RunRecord write/list/get via `/v1/replay/records`
- `apiClient: ApiClient` - Internal REST + WebSocket communication

### Core Entity Hierarchy

**DataEntity** (`src/lib/DataEntity.ts`) - Base class for reactive entities with event emission:
- `Project` (`src/Projects/Project.ts`) - Represents an image/video generation request
- `Job` (`src/Projects/Job.ts`) - Individual generation task within a project

### Communication Layer

**ApiClient** (`src/ApiClient/index.ts`) orchestrates:
- `RestClient` (`src/lib/RestClient.ts`) - HTTP requests with auth
- `WebSocketClient` (`src/ApiClient/WebSocketClient/`) - Real-time events
- `AuthManager` (`src/lib/AuthManager/`) - Token or cookie-based authentication

### Module Structure

```

### Key Patterns

- **Event-driven architecture**: TypedEventEmitter for reactive updates throughout
- **Strategy pattern**: AuthManager with swappable TokenAuthManager/CookieAuthManager
- **Factory pattern**: `SogniClient.createInstance()` for initialization
- **Observer pattern**: Project/Job emit 'updated', 'completed', 'failed' events

### Data Flow

1. User calls `sogni.projects.create()` → Project entity created → 'jobRequest' sent via WebSocket
2. Server sends `jobState`, `jobProgress`, `jobResult` events → Updates Project/Job entities
3. Entities emit events → User code receives 'progress', 'completed', 'failed'

LLM chat flow:

1. User calls `sogni.chat.completions.create()` → SDK sends `llmJobRequest` via WebSocket.
2. Server streams `jobTokens` and terminal `llmJobResult` / `llmJobError` events.
3. Streaming callers iterate `ChatStream`; non-streaming callers receive `ChatCompletionResult`.
4. Hosted REST chat uses `sogni.chat.hosted.create()`; durable chat runs use `sogni.chat.runs`.

Durable workflow flow:

1. User calls `sogni.workflows.start()` with either an inline `input` plan or `workflowId` + `inputs`.
2. REST API persists the workflow and returns a `CreativeWorkflowRecord`.
3. Callers inspect `get()` / `events()` or consume `streamEvents()` with SSE resume support.

### Network Types

- `fast` - High-end GPUs, faster but more expensive. Required for video generation.
- `relaxed` - Mac devices, cheaper. Image generation only.

## Video Model Architecture

The SDK supports two families of video models with **fundamentally different FPS and frame count behavior**.

### Standard Behavior (LTX-2.3 and future models)

**LTX-2.3 Models (`ltx2-*`, `ltx23-*`)** represent the standard behavior going forward. **LTX-2.3 (22B)** is the recommended video model family:
- **Generate at the actual specified FPS** (1-60 fps range)
- No post-render interpolation - fps directly affects generation
- **Frame calculation**: `duration * fps + 1`
- **Frame step constraint**: Frame count must follow pattern `1 + n*8` (i.e., 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, ...)
- Example: 5 seconds at 24fps = 121 frames (snapped to 1 + 15*8 = 121)

### WAN 2.2 Behavior

**WAN 2.2 Models (`wan_v2.2-*`)** use a fixed internal generation rate:
- **Always generate at 16fps internally**, regardless of the user's fps setting
- The `fps` parameter (16 or 32) controls **post-render frame interpolation only**
- `fps=16`: No interpolation, output matches generation (16fps)
- `fps=32`: Frames are doubled via interpolation after generation
- **Frame calculation**: `duration * 16 + 1` (always uses 16, ignores fps)
- Example: 5 seconds at 32fps = 81 frames generated → interpolated to 161 output frames

### External-API Partner Models (Seedance, Happy Horse, Wan 3)

**Seedance 2.0**, **Happy Horse 1.1**, and **Wan 3** (`wan3.0-video`) run on partner external APIs, not Sogni GPU workers:
- **Premium Spark-only** billing and provider-owned fixed frame rates: Seedance/Happy Horse use 24fps, while Wan 3 uses 30fps. All can produce native audio; Wan 3 also supports silent output.
- No local diffusion steps — progress is provider/ETA-derived (still a finite 0-100). Results can arrive as direct hosted URLs, preserved on `job.resultUrl` / `job.getResultUrl()`.
- **Seedance** accepts image + video + audio references (up to 9 / 3 / 3, 12 total) via `referenceImage*` / `referenceImageUrls` / `referenceVideoUrls` / `referenceAudioUrls`. **Happy Horse** accepts **image-only** references (r2v takes 1-9 images via `referenceImage` / `referenceImageUrls`).
- **Wan 3** is one fixed-30fps model for 2-30s T2V/I2V/FLF/R2V/A2V/IA2V generation. It accepts up to 10 loose images, 5 videos, and 5 audios, but native frame mode cannot mix with loose references. Video inputs are loose conditioning, not provider-backed edit/extend tasks.
- Family predicates: `isSeedanceModel()`, `isHappyhorseModel()`, `isExternalApiVideoModel()` in `src/Projects/utils/index.ts`.

### Key Files
- `src/Projects/utils/index.ts` - `isWanModel()`, `isLtx2Model()`, `calculateVideoFrames()`
- `src/Projects/createJobRequestMessage.ts` - Uses `calculateVideoFrames()` for duration→frames conversion
- `src/Projects/types/index.ts` - `VideoProjectParams` interface with detailed documentation

## Git Safety Rules

**CRITICAL: Before running ANY destructive git command (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean`, etc.):**

1. **ALWAYS run `git status` first** to check for uncommitted changes
2. **ALWAYS run `git stash` to preserve uncommitted work** before reset operations
3. After the operation, offer to `git stash pop` to restore the changes

Uncommitted working directory changes are NOT recoverable after `git reset --hard`. Never assume the working directory is clean.

## Commit Message Conventions

This repository uses **conventional commits** for semantic versioning of the npm package:

- **`feat:`** - New features. Triggers a **minor** version bump (e.g., 4.0.0 → 4.1.0)
- **`fix:`** - Bug fixes. Triggers a **patch** version bump (e.g., 4.0.0 → 4.0.1)
- **`chore:`** - Maintenance tasks, documentation, examples. **No version bump** - won't publish a new SDK version

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add support for new video model
fix: Correct frame calculation for LTX-2.3 models
chore: Update example scripts for video generation
```

**Important:** Changes that only affect the `/examples` folder should typically use `chore:` since they don't affect the published SDK package.

## Python Client Parity

There is a second official client, [`sogni-client-python`](https://github.com/Sogni-AI/sogni-client-python),
which is a hand-maintained port of this SDK — not a generated artifact. It does
not update itself when this package publishes.

**Whenever this package publishes a release, port the same change to the Python
client.** A release here that changes the client contract — model IDs and their
validation, request/keyframe shape, event or job fields, socket/recovery
behavior, hosted tool schemas — leaves Python callers on a stale contract until
someone does. The drift is silent: the Python client keeps working and simply
does not know about the new surface.

That has already bitten us. The Python client sat at `5.21.3` while this package
reached `5.27.1`, so it rejected the FastH3 `minimax-h3-fastvideo-int8_*_turbo`
checkpoints as non-video models after they became the default Turbo engine, and
it still failed every in-flight project on a socket drop — behavior removed here
in 5.24.0.

How to port:
1. Read this repo's `CHANGELOG.md` between the Python client's
   `pyproject.toml` version and the new one; each entry is one port.
2. Mirror the change in `sogni-client-python`, matching validation messages and
   wire field names exactly so both clients fail the same way.
3. Sync `sogni_client/data/hosted_tools.json` from
   `src/Chat/_hostedToolsManifest.generated.ts` when tool schemas moved, then
   re-pin `tests/fixtures/hosted-tool-alias-parity.generated.json`.
4. Set the Python version to match this package's version and tag `v<version>`.

Not every release needs a port — a `chore:` release or a Node-only change does
not. Judge by whether the client contract moved.

## LLM Chat — Thinking Models & Tool Calling

### Model Capabilities via `sogni.chat.waitForModels()`

The SDK receives `LLMModelInfo` per model including `maxContextLength`, `maxOutputTokens` (min/max/default), and parameter constraints. Use these to configure `max_tokens` and display limits to users.

Use the returned model constraints as request guidance, and prefer each model's advertised `maxOutputTokens.default` when a caller has not chosen `max_tokens`.

### Thinking Models (Qwen3.x) — `chat_template_kwargs`

Thinking mode is controlled via llama.cpp's `chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking }` per-request parameter. The SDK's `think` param maps to this:
- `think: false` → `chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: false }` (no thinking)
- `think: true` → `chat_template_kwargs: { enable_thinking: true }` (explicit thinking)
- `think: undefined` → omitted (server defaults apply)

The llama-server should run with default `--reasoning-budget -1` (unrestricted) so per-request control works.

`ChatCompletionChunk` exposes generated text through `content` and tool invocations through optional `tool_calls`.

**The solution for structured output**: Use **tool calling** (`tools` + `tool_choice: 'required'`). Tool call arguments are always forwarded by the worker regardless of thinking mode. The `workflow_text_chat_sogni_tools.mjs` example uses this pattern for all composition pipelines (video/image/audio prompt engineering).

### Composition Pipeline Architecture

The example's composition pipelines (composeVideo, composeImage, composeSong) use:
1. **Tool calling as the primary output mechanism** — `tool_choice: 'required'` with a structured tool schema
2. **Trimmed system prompts** — Creative guidance only; structural/format info is in the tool schema (reduces input tokens for tight context windows)
3. **Model info from `waitForModels()`** — `maxOutputTokens.default` for `max_tokens`
